## 2026-09-02 — Expanded 2026 Almanack and Bayer audit

The expanded 2026 Star Almanack now covers the complete ISO 2026 week-year, W01 through W53. ISO 2026 extends beyond the Gregorian year boundary into January 2027; this matters for fixed-object placement. In particular, β Reticuli has a computed best-visibility instant on 2026-12-31 20:05 UTC that rounds to 2027-01-01, which is still ISO 2026-W53-5. The builder was corrected to treat the Almanack as an ISO week-year rather than restricting event injection to Gregorian dates whose year field is 2026.

The fixed-object integration target is all 110 Messier objects plus all catalogued α and β Bayer-designated stars, with separately numbered components retained when appropriate. The successful expanded build currently contains 110 Messier objects and 159 α/β Bayer rows distributed onto the 53 weekly calendar pages by the preserved best-visibility rule.

Bayer completeness is not defined as “every constellation must have both α and β.” Historical Bayer lettering, later constellation boundaries, and the breakup of Argo Navis create legitimate absences. Therefore, missing α/β entries must be audited rather than blindly filled.

Current source-catalog gaps found in the 159-row α/β catalog:

- No α entry: Canes Venatici, Capricornus, Centaurus, Crux, Hercules, Leo Minor, Libra, Norma, Puppis, Vela.
- No β entry: Antlia, Lynx, Norma, Puppis, Sagittarius, Scorpius, Telescopium, Tucana, Vela, Vulpecula.

Working justification rule for future additions:

1. Add an α or β entry only when the Bayer designation is explicitly supported by an authoritative astronomical source, preferably SIMBAD/CDS or another primary/standard catalog.
2. Preserve legitimate historical absences and document why they are absent.
3. Retain separately designated numbered components such as α¹/α² or β¹/β² when the designation is genuinely separate rather than silently collapsing them.
4. Keep the Bayer designation as the stable identity for completeness checking; proper names are supplementary.
5. Do not weaken completeness checks to make a build pass. Resolve catalog, ISO-year, or parsing issues directly.

Initial audit indicates that several current gaps are real catalog omissions rather than legitimate absences. Candidates requiring authoritative confirmation and then addition include α Canum Venaticorum / Cor Caroli components, α Capricorni components, α Centauri, α Crucis components, α Herculis components, α Librae components, β Sagittarii components, β Scorpii components, and β Tucanae components. Conversely, some constellations legitimately lack a modern α or β Bayer designation; examples already identified include Leo Minor, Norma, Puppis, and Vela for α, with several β absences tied to historical boundary changes or incomplete Bayer lettering.

The standard going forward is defensibility and reproducibility: every added Bayer entry should have a traceable astronomical justification, and every intentional gap should be explainable.

## 2026-09-02 — Authoritative gap audit, first pass

The first authoritative cross-check confirms that the current 159-row source catalog is missing genuine Bayer-designated systems. These are not inferred from constellation naming conventions; they are supported by SIMBAD/CDS identifiers or catalog-backed coordinate records.

Confirmed omissions to add:

- α¹ and α² Canum Venaticorum. SIMBAD explicitly identifies α¹ CVn (HD 112412) and α² CVn / Cor Caroli (HD 112413).
- α¹ and α² Capricorni. SIMBAD recognizes the α Capricorni pair and specifically resolves α² Cap; catalog-backed astrometry separately identifies α¹ Cap.
- α Centauri. SIMBAD explicitly recognizes α Cen A and α Cen B; the Bayer identity belongs to the Alpha Centauri system rather than to a missing modern constellation letter.
- α¹ and α² Crucis. Catalog-backed records explicitly identify Alpha1 Crucis and Alpha2 Crucis; α¹ is Acrux.
- α¹ and α² Herculis. SIMBAD identifies α Her as a multiple system and the Washington Double Star Catalog resolves Alpha1 Herculis and Alpha2 Herculis.
- α¹ and α² Librae. Standard catalog records explicitly identify both numbered Bayer components.
- β¹ and β² Sagittarii. SIMBAD-backed records explicitly identify β¹ Sgr and β² Sgr.
- β¹ and β² Scorpii. Standard catalog records explicitly identify both numbered Bayer components.
- β¹ and β² Tucanae. Standard catalog records explicitly identify both numbered Bayer components.

These entries should be added as numbered Bayer entries where numbering is part of the designation. α Centauri should not be artificially converted into α¹/α²; A and B are stellar components of the α Cen system, not numbered Bayer designations.

Legitimate gaps remain legitimate and should stay absent unless contrary catalog evidence is found. The audit therefore distinguishes “no α/β exists in the modern Bayer scheme” from “our source extraction missed an existing Bayer designation.”

Next implementation step: add a small auditable supplemental Bayer source for the confirmed omissions, carrying source provenance and coordinates, then feed that supplement through the same 2026 best-visibility computation and completeness checks instead of editing generated output by hand.

## 2026-09-02 — Bright-star variability and star-note policy

For a future Bright 50 catalog, rank stars by a reproducible representative maximum apparent visual brightness rather than by a one-off exceptional historical observation. This keeps the ranking stable enough to reproduce while still respecting ordinary variability.

Variable and eruptive behavior belongs in the individual star notes. Add a standard field, **Outbursts and exceptional brightness**, whenever applicable. Use it for unusual maxima or minima, eclipses, eruptions, major dimming events, and historically noteworthy departures from the star's representative range. Examples include Betelgeuse's 2019–2020 Great Dimming, Algol's regular eclipses, Mira's unusually bright maxima, and similar exceptional behavior in other variable stars.

The ranking and the notes therefore serve different purposes: the Bright 50 ranking uses a representative maximum, while the star note preserves exceptional observations and outbursts without allowing a rare event to destabilize the catalog order.

## 2026-09-02 — Adopt second-magnitude bright-star layer

Replace the arbitrary Bright 50 cutoff with a physical inclusion rule: include every star whose representative maximum apparent visual magnitude reaches V ≤ +2.50. This should capture essentially all first- and second-magnitude stars while preserving a reproducible threshold.

This bright-star layer is observer-first rather than a replacement for the complete α/β Bayer catalog. Its purpose is to enrich the weekly Almanack with more naked-eye landmarks and more calendar dates carrying useful observing content. Each included bright star should receive its best-visibility date under the same 9 PM local apparent solar time rule used elsewhere in the project, then be available for a concise star note on that date or week.

Star notes may include color, multiplicity, navigation or cultural significance, variability, and the standard **Outbursts and exceptional brightness** field where relevant.

## 2026-09-02 — Magnitude display convention

The Almanack prose should display stellar magnitudes as whole-number visual magnitude classes rather than decimal magnitudes. Decimal precision is retained in the underlying data for calculations and star-chart rendering, where it is useful for differentiating symbol brightness.

For stable stars, display the whole-number class only, such as **V1** or **V2**. For variable stars, display the bright-to-faint class range, such as **V2–V3**, while preserving the precise decimal bright and faint V magnitudes in machine-readable catalog fields. This keeps the printed Almanack visually simple without discarding quantitative precision from the source data.

## 2026-09-02 — Completed Bayer and second-magnitude integration

The Bayer source audit and supplement are now incorporated into the generated catalog. The current audited Bayer source contains 177 rows representing 175 distinct α/β designations; this supersedes the earlier 159-row state recorded above without rewriting that historical log entry.

The second-magnitude layer is defined by representative maximum apparent Johnson V ≤ +2.50, with the Sun excluded. The pinned HYG v4.1 extraction initially produced 95 raw rows. Reconciliation removed the Sun, suppressed a duplicate Capella component, and represented Alpha Centauri as one naked-eye system with flux-combined V while retaining both component identifiers. The resulting baseline contains 92 naked-eye stellar systems: 51 already represented in the α/β Bayer layer and 41 genuinely new non-α/β systems.

The GCVS boundary audit found 81 catalog rows whose listed maximum reaches +2.50 or brighter. Of these, 43 are in the GCVS visual/photovisual/V-system bucket, 3 are explicitly photographic, and 35 use other or blank systems. Reconciliation of the 43 V-system candidates classified 27 as already represented in the HYG bright baseline, 10 as exceptional eruptive/transient maxima that do not define ordinary membership, and 6 as requiring individual source checks. The six were resolved as follows: Polaris (α UMi), Alioth (ε UMa), and γ² Velorum are included; Mira (ο Ceti), η Carinae, and V862 Scorpii are excluded from the ordinary threshold layer, with exceptional brightness retained as note material where appropriate.

Bright-star best-visibility dates use the same observer-first solar-right-ascension rule as the Bayer catalog. The dated bright-star catalog contains all 92 reconciled systems, of which 41 add new non-α/β calendar entries. A year-boundary normalization was required for Algol so its annual occurrence is placed inside ISO 2026 rather than the adjacent Gregorian-year occurrence.

The integrated expanded Almanack build now reports 53 ISO weeks, 110 Messier objects, 177 Bayer rows, and 41 new bright-star systems. CI verifies all 53 week headings, all 371 civil-date rows, and exactly one calendar entry for every one of the 41 new bright-star systems. The ISO-year boundary remains explicit: β Reticuli has best instant 2026-12-31 20:05 UTC, best civil date 2027-01-01, ISO 2026-W53-5.

This establishes the current reproducible 2026 expanded-Almanack baseline. Independent external validation may be performed later as a cross-check, but the repository catalogs, source audits, reconciliation tables, regression tests, and CI remain the primary record of how membership and dates were derived.

## 2026-09-02 — Calendar alias deduplication policy

Deduplication is a presentation rule for the generated weekly calendar, not a catalog-membership rule. The machine-readable Messier, Bayer, and second-magnitude catalogs remain complete and unchanged, and every catalog row must still pass the fixed-object placement completeness check even when a redundant display alias is suppressed.

The scope is deliberately narrow: compare generated fixed-object calendar entries with legacy best-visibility text already present in `almanack.md`. When the legacy text and a generated entry clearly identify the same physical object, retain the existing legacy entry and suppress the additional generated alias. Examples include a proper-name legacy entry such as Aldebaran or Rigel followed by the same star from the complete Bayer catalog, and a descriptive legacy Messier entry followed by the generated bare Messier designation.

Identity is established conservatively. Messier objects are matched by their M-number. Stellar aliases are matched by an explicit proper name when one is available, or by an exact Bayer designation when no proper name is available. The deduplicator does not infer identity from proximity, brightness, constellation membership, or similar-looking names.

Generated catalog rows are never deduplicated against one another. In particular, genuine separately designated components such as α¹/α² or β¹/β² remain separate, and no source row is deleted or collapsed. The deduplicator changes only what is printed in a calendar cell; provenance and catalog completeness remain in the appended catalog sections and source CSV files.

If a generated entry is suppressed because the same object is already represented by legacy calendar text, that catalog row is still recorded as successfully placed for the builder's completeness accounting. This keeps the invariant that all 110 Messier rows, all audited Bayer rows, and all new bright-star rows are accounted for while avoiding duplicate-looking observer-facing entries.

## 2026-09-02 — Cross-date Messier reconciliation

Content audit exposed a legacy Messier duplication that the first alias rule did not catch: M37 appeared once on the generated catalog best date and again as a descriptive legacy entry on the neighboring civil date. Messier identity is therefore reconciled globally across the weekly calendar by M-number, not merely within a single date cell.

For every Messier object, `messier-visibility-2026.csv` is authoritative for the calendar placement date. A legacy `Best visibility:` event carrying the same M-number on any other date is suppressed before generated fixed-object injection. If a descriptive legacy Messier label already appears on the catalog best date, that human-readable label is retained and the bare generated alias is suppressed as before.

This remains a presentation-only rule. All 110 source rows remain unchanged and must still be accounted for by the builder. CI now requires each M1 through M110 identity from the source catalog to occur exactly once in the calendar and specifically on its computed best-visibility date.

## 2026-09-02 — Observer-target deduplication

The calendar-level rule is now: **deduplicate observing targets, not stars**. Machine-readable catalog rows continue to describe the underlying stellar records and are not deleted merely because multiple rows are presented as one practical naked-eye target.

For the Bayer layer, rows with the same exact Bayer designation and the same placement date may share one observer-facing calendar target. The most informative available label is preferred. This resolves the α Comae Berenices case: the two retained source/component records remain in the appended Bayer catalog, while the weekly calendar now prints one target, **Diadem (α Com)**, rather than both `Diadem (α Com)` and `α Com`.

Separately numbered Bayer designations remain separate observing targets. Thus α¹/α² and β¹/β² are not collapsed by this rule. Likewise, physically related stars are not merged merely because they belong to the same gravitational system: a future special-mentions layer may list Proxima Centauri separately from the naked-eye Alpha Centauri A/B observing target.

This rule is presentation-only and observer-first. Every underlying Bayer row still participates in completeness accounting even when more than one row maps to the same calendar target. Future notable-object layers, including nearby stars such as Proxima Centauri and naked-eye stars with confirmed exoplanets, should remain separate from the systematic α/β and V ≤ +2.50 inclusion layers.
